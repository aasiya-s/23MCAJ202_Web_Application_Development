                Holi, often referred to as the "Festival of Colors", is one of the best known festivals outside of India. <br>
                The festival is centered around the burning and destruction of the demoness Holika, which was made possible <br>
                through unwavering devotion to Lord Vishnu. However, the really fun part involves people throwing colored <br>
                powder on each other and squirting each other with water guns. This is associated with Lord Krishna, <br>
                a reincarnation of Lord Vishnu, who liked to play pranks on the village girls by drenching them in water <br>
                and colors. Bhang (a paste made from cannabis plants) is also traditionally consumed during the celebrations. <br>
                Holi is a very carefree festival that's great fun to participate in if you donâ€™t mind getting wet and dirty.

                Diwali honors the victory of good over evil and brightness over darkness. It celebrates Lord Ram and his <br>
                wife Sita returning to their kingdom of Ayodhya, following the defeat of Ravan and rescue of Sita on Dussehra. <br>
                It's known as the "Festival of Lights" for all the fireworks, small clay lamps, andcandles that are lit <br>
                to guide their way. For Indian Hindu families, Diwali is the most anticipated festival of the year.
